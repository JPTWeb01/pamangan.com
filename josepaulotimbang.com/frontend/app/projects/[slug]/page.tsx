      "pamangan.com is a full-stack AI-powered recipe platform celebrating Filipino cuisine and global flavors. Users can discover recipes, generate new ones via AI, build grocery lists from multiple recipes, get per-serving nutrition estimates, and plan meals for the week. The platform uses a database-first search strategy to minimise unnecessary API calls.",
    tech: ["React 18", "Flask", "Python", "MongoDB Atlas", "Gemini 1.5 Flash", "Groq", "PyMongo", "Bootstrap 5", "Koyeb", "Hostinger"],
    features: [
      "AI recipe generation using Gemini 1.5 Flash (primary) and Groq llama-3.3-70b (fallback)",

    challenges:
      "Coordinating two AI providers with silent fallback so users never see an error. Also ensuring the database-first search was fast enough to avoid unnecessary API calls on every keystroke.",
    solutions:
      "Built a service layer that tries Gemini, catches any failure silently, and immediately retries with Groq. MongoDB text indexes on recipe name, cuisine, and tags made DB lookups fast enough to always run first.",
    lessons:
      "AI reliability is not guaranteed — always design for graceful fallback. MongoDB text indexes are powerful but require careful field selection. Separating AI logic into a service class makes it trivially swappable.",

      "AI-generated questions occasionally had ambiguous wording or incorrect answers that slipped through. Also needed a fair timer system consistent across devices.",

      "Added an admin review queue so all AI output is checked before publishing. Server-side timestamps are used for quiz start/end times rather than client-side timers.",
    lessons:

    solutions:
      "Built a tight system prompt that defines the chatbot's persona, scope, and fallback response for out-of-scope questions. Tested with adversarial inputs before going live.",
    lessons:
      "System prompt engineering is as important as the model choice. A well-scoped prompt produces a focused, professional assistant. A loose one produces a general chatbot that doesn't serve the use case.",
